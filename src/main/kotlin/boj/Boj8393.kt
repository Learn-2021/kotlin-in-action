/**
 * 문제
John got a bad mark in math. The teacher gave him another task. John is to write a program which computes the sum of integers from 1 to n. If he manages to present a correct program, the bad mark will be cancelled.

Write a program which:

reads the number n from the standard input,
computes the sum of integers from 1 to n,
writes the answer to the standard output.
입력
The first and only line of the standard input contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000).



출력
One integer is to be written to the standard output. This integer should be the sum of integers from 1 to n.

    var sum = 0
    for (i in 1..n) sum += i
